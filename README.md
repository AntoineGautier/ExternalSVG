# ExternalSVG

Test package illustrating the use of external SVG files.

It includes a fan component model `Fan.mo` with the various patterns that we rely on for the templating, and an example model `ModelWithFan.mo` instantiating that fan component.

Below is the diagram view of that example model as generated by Dymola.
